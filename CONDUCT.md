# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers, we strongly believe in ensuring that we have a welcome environment which is open and inclusive. We will work towards ensuring that all team members pledge to contribute to our project. We pledge to ensure that the participation in this project is free of harassment, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity, and orientation.

## Our Standards

Listed below are a few examples of behavior that we believe helps enable a positive environment:
1. Language that is inclusive, welcoming, and non-judgemental
2. Approaching different viewpoints, suggestions, or experiences in a respectful manner. 
3. Ensuring that we provide and accept constructive feedback in the spirit it is given, that is, to enhance the project. 
4. Put what is best for our team rather than focusing on individual gains.
5. Display empathy towards other teammates knowing that we all have a lot of other things going on besides classes. 


Listed below are a few examples of behavior that is unacceptable:
1. Using language with overt or subvert sexualized messaging or tone, making unwelcome sexual advances or attention. 
2. Making political attacks, using insulting or derogatory language/comments, any form of trolling (be it virtual or in person), and any form of personal or professional attacks that are unwarranted.
3. Any form of harassment, be in a public or private setting.
4. Releasing team member's private data and information without explicit permission. This includes but is not restricted to address, phone number, email address, contact information on any social media etc.
5. Any other behavior or conduct that would be considered inappropriate in any professional setting. While we are working in a cross-cultural environment, there may be some differences across the spectrum. When in doubt, better to dial it back, or ask your project maintainers before trying it out. 

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

Our Code of Conduct not only applies to project and non-project spaces (be it physical, public, virtual, or private spaces). Such representation can be in the form of e-mail, Slack messages, social media messages, or in-person/virtual events. This definition of representing the project can evolve over time and will be agreed upon by all team members. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the `dsci_525_group18` team member at <lnrao@student.ubc.ca>. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a manner that is timely and appropriate to the circumstance. The project team is required to maintain confidentiality regarding the identity of the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
